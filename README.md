## What I did

- Made an API request to get posts to display them as a list
- Added a category filter, multi-select
- Added pagination in the front with numbered pages
- Added pagination in the back to not overload the server. **Important for scalability!**
- Persisted filter state in the query string
- Made it possible to click on a post to see its details
- Made the layout responsive
- Use semantic markup where possible.
- Used Material UI's reusable quality components
